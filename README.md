AI Model Marketplace
Overview
The AI Model Marketplace is a decentralized application (dApp) that allows users to list, purchase, and rate AI models on a blockchain. The application interacts with a smart contract that manages the marketplace, enabling secure transactions and transparent ratings for AI models.

Users can:

List their AI models for sale.
Purchase available AI models.
Rate models after purchasing them.
View details about any listed AI model.
Withdraw funds earned from model sales.
Features
List New AI Model:
Users can list a new AI model by providing a name, description, and price in Ethereum (ETH).

Available Models:
Displays a list of models available for purchase, with information like name, description, and price.

Purchase AI Model:
Allows users to buy a model by entering its ID and confirming the purchase.

Rate Purchased Model:
Users can rate models they've purchased by providing a rating between 1 and 5 stars.

View Model Details:
Enables users to view detailed information about a specific AI model by entering its ID.

Withdraw Funds:
Model creators can withdraw the funds they've earned from selling their models.

Tech Stack
Frontend
HTML5 & CSS3: For structure and styling.
Bootstrap 5: For responsive design and modern UI components.
JavaScript: For interaction with the blockchain through Web3.js.
Backend
Smart Contracts (Solidity): The marketplace logic is handled by smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.
Ganache (Local Blockchain): Used for testing the smart contract locally.
Blockchain Interaction
Web3.js: JavaScript library to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.
MetaMask: Ethereum wallet for handling user transactions and connecting to the smart contract.
Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Node.js & npm: You’ll need to have Node.js installed. You can download it from Node.js Official Website.
